# Electromagnetic-FWI
This program is for 3D electromagnetic full wavefrom inversion implemented by multi-GPU under linux enviroment.
The program is developed based on C/C++ and CUDA

One can find the full instructions of this program in file "program instruction.pdf".

For better understanding of this program, we strongly recomand the users to read our following published paper:
